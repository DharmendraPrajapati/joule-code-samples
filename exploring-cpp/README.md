# Exploring C++ on the Intel Joule
##### By Blain Crabtree and Franklin Baker-Ford
## Introduction
Welcome to Exploring C++ on the Intel Joule! This series will focus on using C++ to work with the Intel Joule development board. All of these lessons rely on completing the setup for Joule, found [here](https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-joule-getting-started). This guide will help walk you through the eight C++ code examples, designed to get you started on the development environment Joule provides. Please note that this is designed to follow along with the code samples provided here. Be sure to read all of the README.md files thoroughly while looking through the code, and before running or compiling the lessons program. Please note, most of these samples have been tested on certain operating systems and carrier boards, be sure to check these for each sample before you run it! Let’s get started!
